The documentation is based on Typst and consists of a `main.typ` file which includes all the separate chapter files in `portfolio/`. You can compile it yourself using `typst compile main.typ` or download the latest PDF file in the release tab. Enjoy!

## Configuration

The configuration (including all Powershell-, Bash-, FortiOS-, Cisco IOSv Scripts) is located in `site-wien/` and `site-heidelberg/` respectively.
